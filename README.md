# üëã Hello there! I'm CookieGMVN!

## Who am I?

My legal name is Tr·∫ßn ƒê√¨nh Tuy·ªÉn (or Tran Dinh Tuyen), but I'd like you to use CookieGMVN, which is my username, to talk to/about/with me, if you don't mind. I come from Vietnam, so Vietnamese is my native language, but I can use English to communicate and read coding documents well. I'm a full-stack developer, but I'm better at back-end, as my design skill is not quite good.
